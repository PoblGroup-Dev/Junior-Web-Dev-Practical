# Technical Test
## Junior Web Developer 

### Overview
Congratulations on making it to the technical interview for the Junior Web Developer role here at Pobl. 
This document contains the information needed to complete the technical task required for this role and will be reviewed by the Applications team. If your solution is successful and meets our requirements, you will be invited to a second interview (in person or virtual). As part your interview you will be required to show and discuss your work and ask us any questions you may have about the role.

### Problem
The onboarding team at Pobl require a web application that allows a user to create a new starter request. The request form will need to include the following:
•	First and Last names
•	Job Title
•	Line manager
•	Start Date
•	Business Area (IT, Finance, HR, Housing, Care) 

An admin user will also need to access the application to review all the new user requests that have been added. This admin user should have the ability to view each request and either mark it as complete or remove it. We have multiple admin users (one for each business area) who are responsible for their requests in those areas.

Please note: As this is testing only frontend development there is no requirement to access and use a database.

Things to note:
•	Can use any front-end framework/library (ideally React or NextJs) 
•	Can use your own preferred styling (Tailwindcss, Styled Components, CSS, SASS) 
•	Assume any user can use this app (not required to set up user authentication)
•	Submit solution to GitHub and provide the link at your interview
•	No need to deploy your solution

### Submission
You have 5 days to complete (shouldn’t take no longer than 4 hours) and provide a solution to the problem above. All submissions should be uploaded into a public GitHub repository with a link emailed to:
liam.moseley@poblgroup.co.uk
rich.griffiths@poblgroup.co.uk

If you have any questions about the technical test, please feel free to get in touch with Liam or Richard (emails above).

Best of luck!
